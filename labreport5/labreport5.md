Lab Report 5: Grading Script
============================

Here is the link to my grading bash script: [grader](grade1.sh).

A little summary of the code:
The bash script takes in a directory that contains a java file called ListExamples.java. It checks the folowing before running a tester: the file with the right name is found, it compiles successfully, has a matching method signature (so the tester will be able to call the method, lastly that the test passes. If a process fails, it prints out the message generated by java or JUnit.

I tested this grading script on all the examples java files given on the course website, and will show you the output of the sciprt given each java file.


1. File from Lab 3
Expect behavior:
- File: found
- Compile: successful
- Method Signature: match
- Test: fail as the third `while` loop in the code is supposed to iterate through list 2 but updates the index of list 1.

2. Corrected File
Expect behavior:
- File: found
- Compile: successful
- Method Signature: match
- Test: pass since the issue that failed the first file is fixed.

3. File with Compile Error
- File: found
- Compile: failed due to syntax error: missing semi-colon on line 15
- Method Signature: Not applicatble as bash script exists as soon as compilation fails.
- Test: Not applicatble as bash script exists as soon as compilation fails.

4. Different Method Signature


5. Different Filename


6. File Nested Inside Another Directory

Installing VScode
=================
Install VScode (Visual Studio Code) [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Remotely Connecting
===================
Once you've downloaded VS code. Open VS code and press `Ctrl`/`command` + `+` to open the terminal.
Now enter `ssh` followed by your account (ex. `cs15lwi23akm@ieng6.ucsd.edu`). For connecting for the first time, you will see the following message:

```
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.238)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Type `yes`. Then it will ask you for your password, enter your password (it will not display what you've entered as password, but you have entered it).

Now, you have connected to a computer in the lab. When you enter commands, you can now view/manipulate files on the lab computer.
